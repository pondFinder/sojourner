  Sojourner- An app for exploration!

Sojourner is a new app exposing users to points of interest and fellow explorers at home or abroad based upon their personal user profile.

Let Sojourner be your tour guide wherever you explore, whether at home or abroad. Sojourner will show you unique destinations activities and more all based upon your personal interests as soon as you land on your homepage or on the tarmac!

Researching what to do and see in every city for a frequent flyer or cross country tour can become repetitive  and dull. With Sojourner you can let our database do the work for you, automatically pointing you in the right direction no matter what city you visit!

"Sojourner would be a great project for any Legacy group that was looking to work with Google Api, and React with lots of room to expand existing and new features." -Sean Brock

Getting started on sojourner is easy! All you need to do is visit https://protected-refuge-31667.herokuapp.com and follow the simple user creation and log in steps and you can get started today.

"As a hypothetical flight attendant I enjoy the convenience of opening up Sojourner app and immediately being able to checkout a few cool points of interest nearby during a long layover or just on the way to or from the Hotel."

To find out more please attend the Senior Greenfield presentation in the HRR24 Zoom on July 3rd!

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

Sojourner- An app for exploration!

Sojourner is a new app exposing users to points of interest and fellow explorers at home or abroad based upon their personal user profile.

Let Sojourner be your tour guide wherever you explore, whether at home or abroad. Sojourner will show you unique destinations, activities and more all based upon your personal interests as soon as you land on your homepage or on the tarmac!

Researching what to do and see in every city for a frequent flyer or cross country tour can become repetitive  and dull. With Sojourner you can let our database do the work for you, automatically pointing you in the right direction no matter what city you visit!

"Sojourner would be a great project for any Legacy group that was looking to work with Google Api, and React with lots of room to expand existing and new features." -Sean Brock

"As a hypothetical flight attendant I enjoy the convenience of opening up Sojourner app and immediately being able to checkout a few cool points of interest nearby during a long layover or just on the way to or from the Hotel."
